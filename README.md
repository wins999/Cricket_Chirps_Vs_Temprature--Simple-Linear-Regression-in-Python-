# Cricket Chirps Vs Temprature Simple Linear regression

In this project I we use the Cricket Chirps Vs Temprature data create a Simple Linear Regression model and test how well will the model predict the Temprature on given Cricket Chirps :sunglasses: <br>
This is a Cricket Insect :cold_sweat: <br> <br>

### Prerequisites

Download and Install Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/<br>
Spyder 3.3.4 <br>
Python 3.6<br>
Libraries required in python are numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas please download it before importing

### Results 

Based on the Cricket Chirps given temprature  and the temprature predicted by our model are compared.:white_check_mark:<br>

Given Test Temprature (y_test)in middle <br>
Predicted Temprature  (y_pred_test_data) at right <br> <br>
